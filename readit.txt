This repository contains a simple Gradio-based chatbot for Mahat.ai.

Files:
- README.md: minimal heading with the project name.
- app.py: launches a Gradio interface that uses a DistilBERT QA pipeline and SentenceTransformer embeddings with FAISS to answer questions from the knowledgebase.
- knowledgebase.txt: a collection of Q&A pairs about Mahat.ai separated by lines containing '---'.
- requirements.txt: lists the Python dependencies (gradio, transformers, sentence-transformers, faiss-cpu, torch).

The chatbot searches the knowledge base for the closest question and provides an answer via the QA model when run.
